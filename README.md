# JasonWangGame
An iPhone app that I made for fun. The idea for this game was created by Jason Wang, my friend.
In the game, a slider that ranges from 0 to 50 is to be moved to some given number (by way of guessing and estimation). Getting the number increases score by 5 points and missing decreases score by 1. When score reaches 10, a picture of Jason Wang will appear on the screen with congratulating words. 

Note: The background.png asset was obtained online for free use and not my own. The pictures of Jason Wang are my own screenshots.
